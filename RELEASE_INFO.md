Improvements

Bug Fixes
- Fixed the missing "Set as Ringtone" option in the player menu
- Fixed Unison lyrics rendering raw TTML XML instead of proper synced text
- Fixed compilation errors in the Listen Together screen and player menu
- Fixed settings search navigating to the wrong highlight, including settings with spaces in their name; added a proper visual highlight and improved scroll behavior to center the setting on screen
- Fixed a touch ripple effect bleeding out of bounds when selecting a song in lists
- Fixed songs liked on YouTube Music failing to sync to NullMusic due to missing playlist video IDs
- Fixed NullMusic repeatedly overwriting the liked date of songs during sync, which now preserves local sorting and prevents accidental re-uploads to YouTube Music
- Fixed an issue affecting liked playlist songs
